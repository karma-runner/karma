Jenkins CI Integration
========================

`Jenkins CI <http://jenkins-ci.org/>`_ is one of the most popular continuous integration servers in the market today. At some point while developing your `Angular <http://angularjs.org>`_ project (hopefully early on), you might want to have automated tests run off your code versioning system. Jenkins will help you with this task. You can integrate testacular to your Jenkins setup fairly easy and as of version 0.3.12, test results can be "pretty printed" into a format Jenkins understands (i.e. no need to hunt down failures in the console log). This tutorial assumes you have Jenkins already setup and running on your CI environment.

Setup
#######

1. Install Node and testacular as per :doc:`installation` on your Jenkins CI server.
2. Highly suggest installing the following Jenkins plug-in: `EnvInject <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/EnvInject+Plugin>`_ as it makes things easier under certain linux distributions and user permissions.
3. Make the following additions and changes to your testacular config file as needed:

.. code-block:: javascript

    singleRun = true;
    reporters = ['dots', 'junit'];
    junitReporter = {
    outputFile: 'test-results.xml'
    };

Please note the test-result.xml file will be output to the present working directory (and you will need to tell Jenkins where to find it).

4. In Jenkins, start a new job for Angular/Testacular with the basic settings (Name, description, parameters, source code repo to pull from, etc.)
5. Go to the job page and click on configure.
6. In the Build Environment sub-section, check the "Inject environment variables to the build process" checkbox. A few textboxes will appear and in the "Properties Content" box set the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
    PHANTOMJS_BIN=/usr/local/bin/phantomjs #or wherever PhantomJS happens to be installed

7. Further down the page, in the Post-build Actions sub-section add a "Publish JUnit test result report" from the Post-build action drop down menu. When the textbox labeled Test report XMLs appears, enter the path to where the test-results.xml is relative to the root of your Jenkins job workspace.
