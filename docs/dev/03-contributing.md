If you are thinking about making Karma better, or you just want to hack on it, thatâ€™s great!
Here are some tips to get you started.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* [Submit](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/issues/new) a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not
  already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes
* Clone your fork
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/karma.git
```
* Init your workspace

```bash
$ ./scripts/init-dev-env.js
```

* Checkout a new branch (usually based on `master`) and name it accordingly to what
  you intend to do
  * Features get the prefix `feature-`
  * Bug fixes get the prefix `fix-`
  * Improvements to the documentation get the prefix `docs-`

## Testing and Building
Run the tests via
```bash
# All tests
$ grunt test

$ grunt test:unit
$ grunt test:e2e
$ grunt test:client
```
Lint the files via
```bash
$ grunt lint
```
Build the project via
```bash
$ grunt build
```
The default task, just calling `grunt` will run `build lint test`.
