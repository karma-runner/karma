pageTitle: Developing Plugins

Karma can be extended through plugins. A plugin is essentially an npm module. Typically, there are four kinds of plugins: **frameworks**, **reporters**, **launchers** and **preprocessors**. The best way to understand how this works is to take a look at some of the existing plugins. Following sections list some of the plugins that you might use as a reference.

## Frameworks
- example plugins: [karma-jasmine], [karma-mocha], [karma-requirejs]
- use naming convention is `karma-*`
- use npm keywords `karma-plugin`, `karma-framework`.

## Reporters
- example plugins: [karma-growl-reporter], [karma-junit-reporter]
- use naming convention is `karma-*-reporter`
- use npm keywords `karma-plugin`, `karma-reporter`

## Launchers
- example plugins: [karma-chrome-launcher], [karma-sauce-launcher]
- use naming convention is `karma-*-launcher`
- use npm keywords `karma-plugin`, `karma-launcher`

## Preprocessors
- example plugins: [karma-coffee-preprocessor], [karma-ng-html2js-preprocessor]
- use naming convention is `karma-*-preprocessor`
- user npm keywords `karma-plugin`, `karma-preprocessor`

## Crazier stuff
Karma is assembled by Dependency Injection and a plugin is just an additional DI module (see [node-di] for more), that can be loaded by Karma. Therefore it can asks for pretty much any Karma component and interact with it. There are couple of plugins that do more interesting stuff like this, check out [karma-closure], [karma-intellij], [karma-dart].

## Karma Framework API

Karma Framework connect existing testing libraries to Karma's API, so that their
results can be displayed in a browser and sent back to the server.

Karma frameworks _must_ implement a `window.__karma__.start` method that Karma will
call to start test execution. This function is called with an object that has methods
to send results back to karma:

* `.result` a single test has finished
* `.complete` the client completed execution of all the tests
* `.error` an error happened in the client
* `.info` other data (eg. number of tests or debugging messages)

Most commonly you'll use the `result` method to send individual test success or failure
statuses. The method takes an object of the form:

```js
{
    // test id
    id: String,

     // test description
    description: String,

    // the suite to which this test belongs. potentially nested.
    suite: Array[String],

    // an array of string error messages that might explain a failure.
    // this is required if success is false.
    log: Array[String],

    success: Boolean, // pass / fail

    skipped: Boolean // skipped / ran
}
```
