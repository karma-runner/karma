## The reasons for these conventions:
- automatic generating of the changelog
- simple navigation through git history (eg. ignoring style changes)

## Format of the commit message:
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```


## Message subject (first line)
First line cannot be longer than 70 characters, second line is always
blank and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.

### Allowed `<type>` values:

* **feat** (new feature)
* **fix** (bug fix)
* **docs** (changes to documentation)
* **style** (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
* **refactor** (refactoring production code)
* **test** (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
* **chore** (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

### Example `<scope>` values:

* init
* runner
* watcher
* config
* web-server
* proxy
* etc.

The `<scope>` can be empty (eg. if the change is a global or difficult
to assign to a single component), in which case the parentheses are
omitted.


## Message body
* uses the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
* includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior

## Message footer

### Referencing issues
Closed issues should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword like this:
```bash
Closes #234
```
or in case of multiple issues:
```bash
Closes #123, #245, #992
```
### Breaking changes

All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the
description of the change, justification and migration notes.
```bash
BREAKING CHANGE:

`port-runner` command line option has changed to `runner-port`, so that it is
consistent with the configuration file syntax.

To migrate your project, change all the commands, where you use `--port-runner`
to `--runner-port`.
```
