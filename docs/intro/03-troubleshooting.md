## Windows

### Tips & Tricks

* Use [chocolatey] for installation of tools. It helps. A lot.

### Specific problems

* Chrome won't start. (Issues: [#202], [#74])

  1. Set `CHROME_BIN` like this
     ```
     > export CHROME_BIN='C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe'
     ```
  3. Increase the timeout from 5000ms to 10000ms. At 5000ms, timeouts
     occurred and the retry logic kicks in and eventually resolves
     after two to three tries.


## Unix

### Tips & Tricks
In the event that your tests fail or freeze, this may be the result of
a browser having a display message show up, a browser update prompt or
extension-related conflict that needs to be taken care of.
