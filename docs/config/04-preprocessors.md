Preprocessors in Karma allow you to do some work with your files before
they get served to the browser. These are configured in the `preprocessors` block
of the configuration file:

```javascript
preprocessors: {
  '**/*.coffee': ['coffee'],
  '**/*.tea': ['coffee'],
  '**/*.html': ['html2js']
},
```

Note: There are multiple expressions referencing the "coffee" preprocessor in this example, as a preprocessor
can be listed more than once as another way to specify multiple file path expressions.

Note: Most of the preprocessors need to be loaded as [plugins].

## Available Preprocessors
- [coffee]
- [html2js]
  - Note any .html files listed in the files section must be referenced at run time as `window.__html__['template.html']`. [Learn more](html2js).
  - If this preprocessor is disabled, included .html files will need `base/` added to beginning of their path reference. See [discussion in issue 788][issue788].
- [coverage]
- [ng-html2js]
- [many more](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/karma-preprocessor)

Here's an example of how to add the CoffeScript preprocessor to your testing suite:

```bash
# Install it first with NPM
$ npm install karma-coffee-preprocessor --save-dev
```

And then inside your configuration file...

```javascript
module.exports = function(config) {
  config.set({
    preprocessors: {
      '**/*.coffee': ['coffee']
    }
  });
};
```

Of course, you can write [custom plugins] too!


## Configured Preprocessors
Some of the preprocessors can be also configured:

```javascript
coffeePreprocessor: {
  options: {
    bare: false
  }
}
```

Or define a configured preprocessor:

```javascript
customPreprocessors: {
  bare_coffee: {
    base: 'coffee',
    options: {bare: true}
  }
}
```


## Minimatching
The keys of the preprocessors config object are used to filter the files specified in
the `files` configuration.

* First the file paths are expanded to an absolute path, based on the
  `basePath` configuration and the directory of the configuration file. See
  [files] for more information on that.
* Then the newly expanded path is matched using [minimatch] against the specified key.

So for example the path `/my/absolute/path/to/test/unit/file.coffee` matched against
the key `**/*.coffee` would return `true`, but matched against just `*.coffee` it would
return `false` and the preprocessor would not be executed on the CoffeeScript files.

## Order of execution

If a file matches only one key in the preprocessors config object, then karma
will execute the preprocessors over that file in the order they are listed in
the corresponding array.  So for instance if the config object is:

```js
preprocessors: {
  '*.js': ['a', 'b']
}
```

Then karma will execute `'a'` before executing `'b'`.

If a file matches multiple keys, karma will do its best to execute the
preprocessors in a reasonable order.  So if you have:

```js
preprocessors: {
  '*.js': ['a', 'b'],
  'a.*': ['b', 'c']
}
```

then for `a.js`, karma will run `'a'` then `'b'` then `'c'`.  If two lists
contradict eachother, like:

```js
preprocessors: {
  '*.js': ['a', 'b'],
  'a.*': ['b', 'a']
}
```

then karma will arbitrarily pick one list to prioritize over the other.  In a
case like:

```js
preprocessors: {
  '*.js': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
  'a.*': ['c', 'b', 'd']
}
```

Then `'a'` will definitely be run first, `'d'` will definitely be run last, but
it's arbitrarily if karma will run `'b'` before `'c'` or vice versa.
