# Karma [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/karma-runner/karma.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/karma-runner/karma)

A simple tool that allows you to execute JavaScript code in multiple
_real_ browsers, powered by [Node.js] and [Socket.io].

> The main purpose of Karma is to make your TDD development easy,
>  fast, and fun.

## When should I use Karma?

* You want to test code in *real* browsers.
* You want to test code in multiple browsers (desktop, mobile,
  tablets, etc.).
* You want to execute your tests locally during development.
* You want to execute your tests on a continuous integration server.
* You want to execute your tests on every save.
* You love your terminal.
* You don't want your (testing) life to suck.
* You want to use [Istanbul] to automagically generate coverage
  reports.
* You want to use [RequireJS] for your source files.


## But I still want to use \_insert testing library\_

Karma is not a testing framework, neither an assertion library,
so for that you can use pretty much anything you like. Right now out
of the box there is support for

* [Mocha]
* [Jasmine]
* [QUnit]
* \_anything else\_ Write your own adapter. It's not that hard. And we
  are here to help.


## Which Browsers can I use?

All the major browsers are supported, if you want to know more see the
[Browsers] page.


## I want to use it. Where do I sign?

You don't need to sign anything but here are some resources to help
you to get started. And if you need even more infos have a look at our
great [website].

### Obligatory Screencast.

Every serious project has a screencast, so here is ours.  Just click
[here] and let the show begin.

### NPM Installation.

If you have [Node.js] installed, it's as simple as

```bash
$ npm install -g karma
```

This will give you the latest stable version available on npm. If you
want to live life on the edge you can do so by

```bash
$ npm install -g karma@canary
```

The curious can have a look at the documentation articles for
[Getting Started] and [Versioning].

### Using it.

Go into your project and create a Karma configuration. That is
just a simple JavaScript or CoffeeScript file that tells Karma
where all the awesomeness of your project are.

You can find a simple example in
[test/client/karma.conf.js](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/test/client/karma.conf.js)
which contains most of the options.

To create your own from scratch there is the `init` command, which
will be named `karma.conf.js` by default:

```bash
$ karma init
```
This will ask you many questions and if you answered them all correct
you will be allowed to use Karma.

For more information on the configuration options see
[Configuration File Overview].

Now that you have your configuration all that is left to do is to
start Karma:
```bash
$ karma start
```

If you want to run tests manually (without auto watching file changes), you can:
```bash
$ karma run
```
But only if you have started the Karma server before.


## Why did you create this?

Throughout the development of [AngularJS], we've been using [JSTD] for
testing. I really think that JSTD is a great idea. Unfortunately, we
had many problems with JSTD, so we decided to write our own test
runner based on the same idea. We wanted a simple tool just for
executing JavaScript tests that is both stable and fast. That's why we
use the awesome [Socket.io] library and [Node.js].


## I still don't get it. Where can I get help?

* [Docs]
* [Mailing List]
* [Issuetracker]
* [@JsKarma] on Twitter

## This is so great. I want to help.
