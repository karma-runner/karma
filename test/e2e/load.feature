Feature: Basic Testrunner
  In order to use Karma
  As a person who wants to write great tests
  I want Karma to terminate upon misconfiguration

  Scenario: Execute with missing browser
    Given a configuration with:
      """

        'karma-chrome-launcher'
      ];
      singleRun = false
      """
    When I start Karma
    Then it fails with like:
      """
      Cannot load browser "NonExistingBrowser": it is not registered! Perhaps you are missing some plugin\?
      """
    And it fails with like:
