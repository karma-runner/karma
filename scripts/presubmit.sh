# On presubmit branches (eg. presubmit-master-xxx or presubmit-stable-xxx),
# this script merges the changes into the main branch (master/stable).
#
# If there are any fix/feat changes, it also pushes a new release to npm.
#
# If the main branch (master/stable) can't be fast-forwarded, a merge is done and the presubmit
# branch is pushed to upstream to get tested again.
#
# If the merge fails, the presubmit branch has to be merged manually and pushed again.
#
# This script only runs:
# - on the main repo (no forks),
# - on the leader VM (if the build contains multiple VMs),
# - on presubmit branches.
